# Language Classification with MFCCs

## Overview

This project demonstrates language classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and a neural network model. The model is trained to classify spoken languages based on audio features extracted using MFCCs.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in the `processed_data.csv` file. It includes audio features (MFCCs) and corresponding language labels.
The original data/audios is taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hbchaitanyabharadwaj/audio-dataset-with-10-indian-languages
